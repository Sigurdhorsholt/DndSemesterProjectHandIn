# 3. Blogpost - Web Application

[](https://github.com/Sigurdhorsholt/DndSemesterProjectHandIn/blob/main/2.%20blogpost.md#2-blogpost---web-service-design--implementation)


- Describe how your key requirements are implemented in your web application. Provide code examples.
 - Give an overview of the pages in your web application. 
 - Describe how your frontend connects to your web service. Provide code examples

### Description of the web app and its pages:

pages:
- "/"
Homepage where user can Login. NavBar is visible and only options are pages that does not require user to be logged in
- "/UserDashboard" 
 A dashboard where a user can scroll through dates. See the available laundryslots per date and make new reservations. 
 
- "/AdminDashboard"
A dashboard where the Admin can configure settings for each laundryroom that he manages. He can see all his users. He can add to them or delete from them..

- "/Home"
ReRoutes to "/" page. If status is logged in then The user can press logout otherwise the user can login from here


- "/About"
Not implemented

- "/Profile"
implementaion pending...


- **The navbar**
The navbar is conditional and checks the status of a service called AuthState.cs. When a user logs in a "CurrentUser" is set. This user has a flag for being an admin or not and being logged in or not.. 



### Visualization of pages:

**Home page before being logged in:**

**Navbar conditional rendering:**

### User Stories and how we implemented them:
We will not go in depth with every story but highlight the most important ones.. 


DateSelector:
![Dateselector](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6769faf8-1757-48dd-ad27-a9b07bd26041)

Available Machines
![Available machines](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4307b08-d317-40f8-9f87-82773e2fa536)
And if we seelct a machine
![Available machines Selected one](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4336274f-d060-4e2e-955f-5faf8432e271)

Timeslots: 

![Timeslots m 1 booking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0f60619-9730-45c6-936d-9fed7327e09f)

Please note the difference above to below here is a setting that allows users to see Who made the booking. An admin might want privacy settings for a room.

![Timeslots m 1 booking no show info](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cfae8a4-76f5-4bdd-bcd9-9ae82153dc26)

If we try to make a booking:
![Confirm booking modal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/96eed249-accc-4d2f-a6a3-f3097c82f329)


**Admin dashboard**

First you get shown the rooms available:
![Admin dashboard no selected room](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/988ac6a3-bdcb-4e0e-9f94-74589b91d497)

Once you pick a room you see current configuration for this room + options to change these configurations:

![Admin dashboard selected room](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91b9c151-a0b3-4d91-9796-08970e37a3dd)

You can add Machines and timeslots

![tilføk maskine 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/64cfdfcb-a0bc-41c3-ba2c-2e9cf615420c)

Settings will reflect nicely in the userdashboard:

### How the frontend works:


The Besides having the .razor files for each page and for each component there are some services configured. 

These are: 

- AuthStateService
- BookingService
- LaundryRoomService

These are injected into our pages and are responsible for making actual API calls and storing the responses as state. This state is used across the different pages. 
The actual timing of when state is loaded and which service methods are called is handled on the pages themselves - but the state is stored and referenced in the Services.

In order to be able to inject them  they are registered as Scoped services in the programs.cs: 

    builder.Services.AddScoped<BookingService>();  
    builder.Services.AddScoped<LaundryRoomService>();  
    builder.Services.AddScoped<AuthStateService>();

**Model**
The model on the frontend is handled by having a lot of small Data transferring objects (DTO's). These are made to mimic the objects being sent from the backend through the API. It makes it easier working with DTO's since it streamlines how things are done throughout the app. A timeslot object is the same on the settings page as in the user dashboard page.



**Connection to API:**

To enable seamless communication between our Blazor frontend and the backend web API, we implemented an HTTP-based architecture using Blazor WebAssembly. Here’s how the connection works:

1. **Base Address Configuration:**

 - The `HttpClient` service is configured with the base address of our backend API. This ensures that all HTTP requests from the frontend are routed to the correct server. 
 - **Defining the Base Address** 

    builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5257/") });
    
- Here, `http://localhost:5257/` is the base address of our backend API during development. This can be replaced with a production URL when deployed.




Example of using the registered HttpClient in one of the services by DI: 

    public class LaundryRoomService  
    {  
      private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;  
          
        [Inject]  
        private BookingService _BookingService { get; set; }  
          
        // Inject HttpClient via constructor  
        public LaundryRoomService(HttpClient httpClient, BookingService bookingService)  
        {  
          _httpClient = httpClient;  
          _BookingService = bookingService;  
        }

httpClient can then be used in methods accessing routes in the class and C# handles disposing of the client instance after use... 

using httpClient like this allows us to use all of it's build in methods. We can manage headers. We can read responses in different ways like cheching response status codes or serializing to a local DTO from Json responses.. We can also handle API route parameters and passing objects as part of request bodies.... It simplifies http connections with the API backend alot and is really nice to work with!

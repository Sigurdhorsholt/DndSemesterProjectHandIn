About 80% of the project has been done at VIA sitting in a shared class room working together at a big screen.
We initially had a different repository where we had implemented the entire project in react and with a different database system. When we changed this we also made a new repo where most fiels from the backend were copied over

Overall the work reflects all of out efforts

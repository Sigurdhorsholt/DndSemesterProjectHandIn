In this blog post, we will describe the design and implementation of the RESTful web API for our Laundry Room Management System. The API is a central component of our project, facilitating seamless communication between the backend and frontend by exposing endpoints to manage users, bookings, laundry machines, and settings. Our focus has been on ensuring modularity, maintainability, and scalability throughout the API's design.


We decided to make the Database layer prior to implementing the API. This way setting up the Entity Framework and structuring the API routes on top of the data would be easier. 

We had initially implemented everything with MySql Server Database and raw SQL queries in every controller.. We realized later that we had to use SQLITE and use dotnet LINQ for quering so we merged everything to this setup instead. 

Database can we inspected in the SqlLite file in the repository. 

*If this Repo is Cloned the filepath for the DB needs to be specified in the Program.cs:* 

    var filePath = "C:\\Users\\sigur\\OneDrive\\Dokumenter\\GitHub\\DndSemesterProjectHandIn\\SemesterProject\\SqliteDB\\DataBase.sqlite";
    
    if (!File.Exists(filePath))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"File not found: {filePath}");
    }
We register the database in our `Program.cs` as a Dbcontext:

    builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext> (
    options => 
    options.UseSqlite($"Data Source={filePath}"));

The registered class to handle our database connection is the 

    ApplicationDbContext.Cs
    
Which can be found in the Repository. This class is called throughout the API whenever the datamodel / database needs to be used.
It instantiates a Model Entity class for each table in database: 

    // Define DbSets for each table you need to interact with  
        public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<ApartmentComplex> ApartmentComplexes { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<LivesIn> LivesIn { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<Booking> Bookings { get; set; } // Added Bookings DbSet  
        public DbSet<Timeslot> Timeslots { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<LaundryRoom> LaundryRooms { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<LaundryMachine> LaundryMachines { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<AdminManages> AdminManages { get; set; }  
        public DbSet<ComplexSettings> ComplexSettings { get; set; }


 Once it is instantiated we override a built in method called `OnModelCreating()`In this method we define relationships and keys between entities in model: 

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder) {
	modelBuilder.Entity<LaundryRoom>() 
     .HasOne(lr => lr.ApartmentComplex)
     .WithMany(ac => ac.LaundryRooms) 
     .HasForeignKey(lr => lr.ComplexId) 
     .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);}
    (Example... Real method has configuration of all tables - mapping them to our entity framework)


Here our Data model can be seen as an ER diagram. As mentioned it is a Sqlite database made in datagrip:

## How the API works

The program.cs Class is the entry point of our application. The main concepts used are 
#### Dependency Injection (DI) 
We register some services on program.cs to be used throughout ex:
- DbContext as described above. 
- Register CORS for it to work with seperate blazor frontend.
- Authentication: We configure JWT based auth to secure endpoints and validate users. 

#### Middelwares
After all services has been registered to builder we register middlewares on the "app" : `var app = builder.Build();`

- Swagger
- Use specified Cors configurations
- **Authentication and Authorization**: for validating user identity
- Controllers are mapped

DI is really smart since ASP.NET handles spinning up new DbContexts and Controller instances instead of manually keeping track of which threads / clients needs a db connection or an instance of a controller.... Saves us a headache and is efficient.





## Designing the Data Model

**Entity Framework Core**
To streamline database interactions, we used Entity Framework Core (EF Core). EF Core allows us to define our data model in C# and reference it using Linq and use entities as Collections instead of using raw SQL queries.

**Data Model Design**

The primary entities in our system are:

*User*
Stores information about the users (e.g., admins, tenants).
Relationships: A user can belong to an apartment complex and may have bookings.

*ApartmentComplex*
Represents the apartment complexes with laundry facilities.
Relationships: Each complex can have multiple users and laundry rooms.

*LaundryRoom*
Represents individual laundry rooms within an apartment complex.
Relationships: A laundry room can contain multiple laundry machines and bookings.

*LaundryMachine*
Represents individual machines (e.g., washers and dryers) within a laundry room.
Relationships: Machines can have bookings.

*Timeslot*
- Represents the time slots available for bookings.
- Relationships: A timeslot is associated with an apartment complex and bookings.

*Booking*
- Represents a user booking a laundry machine for a specific timeslot.
- Relationships: A booking links a user, laundry machine, timeslot, and laundry room.


## Developing the Web API


### **Controller Structure**

Each main entity has a corresponding controller. 

-   **UserController**: Manages user registration, retrieval, and deletion.
-   **BookingController**: Handles booking operations.
-   **LaundryRoomController**: Manages laundry rooms and their machines.
-   **SettingsController**: Updates and retrieves settings for laundry rooms.

### **AuthController**

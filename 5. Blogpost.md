- Describe how the introduction of an ORM changes how you work with data in your system. 
- Describe how using LINQ is different to the traditional SQL approach. Provide code examples.

### Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

The introduction of a **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)**, specifically Entity Framework Core in our project, really simplified the way we interact with the database.  We had implemeted the Database and all data queries in MySql and using raw sql statements in our controllers before the lesson where we were introduced to LINQ and ORM. 
So we saw the difference between writing queries as plain strings with variables concatenated on to them. 
This took alot of time and often there were syntax errors that our IDE could not catch for us...
With ORM, the database was abstracted into **object-oriented models**, allowing us to work directly with classes and properties instead of tables and columns. 
This meant that we could use LINQ. An example was when we tried to retrieve a list of all bookings. 

Instead of writing a c# table we could now work with a  collection of `List<BookingDto>.Where(b => b.date == selectedDate.date)`

The challenge was to correctly map the DB tables to objects with the correct attributes as variables.

How this works is elaborated in blogpost 2. However a very good example of a simplified query could be how users are accessed: 
**Traditional SQL:**

    string sql = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE IsAdmin = 1";
    var users = new List<User>();
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        var command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection);
        using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
        {
            while (reader.Read())
            {
                users.Add(new User
                {
                    UserId = (int)reader["UserId"],
                    UserName = reader["UserName"].ToString(),
                    IsAdmin = (bool)reader["IsAdmin"]
                });
            }
        }
    }

**LINQ and using our Entity Framwork:**

    var users = _context.Users.Where(u => u.IsAdmin).ToList();

Also filtering a query and performing joins on the database tables are much easier to read and comprehend after we started to use LINQ: 

**Traditional SQL join:**

    SELECT u.UserName, a.ComplexName 
    FROM Users u
    JOIN LivesIn l ON u.UserId = l.UserId
    JOIN ApartmentComplex a ON l.ComplexId = a.ComplexId;

**Using LINQ to perform join:**

    var query = _context.Users
        .Join(
            _context.LivesIn,
            user => user.UserId,
            livesIn => livesIn.UserId,
            (user, livesIn) => new { user, livesIn })
        .Join(
            _context.ApartmentComplexes,
            combined => combined.livesIn.ComplexId,
            complex => complex.ComplexId,
            (combined, complex) => new { combined.user.UserName, complex.ComplexName });

Here LINQ queries provide a more **intuitive syntax** that directly maps to object relationships. Making it easier to comprehend while developing...

# Final Development Report


**Backend Infrastructure**

-   Implemented a robust laundry room booking system with full CRUD operations for entities.
-   Established secure user authentication using JWT.

-   Created admin-specific views for managing users, laundry rooms, and system configurations.


**User Management**

-   Integrated role-specific features, with standard users focusing on bookings and admins managing the system.
-   Provided a mechanism for admins to register and delete users for each laundry room.

**Admin Tools**

## Project Outcome

The laundry booking system prototype achieves its primary objectives and delivers a functional solution for managing laundry schedules in apartment complexes. At its current state it is more focused on managing the system from an Administrators point of view - but better solutions for the end user can be optimized later.

Key features include:

-   **Efficient Booking System**: Users can browse and  book laundry timeslots seamlessly.
-   **Role-Based Access Control**: Admins and users have clearly defined roles and permissions for streamlined system usage.

-   **Admin Configuration Tools**: Admins have complete control over users, laundry rooms, and system settings, allowing for effective management across multiple complexes.

## Summary

- Most initial requirements from the user stories have been **fully implemented**. However some have been left partially implemeted or not at all.
- Both **Daily Users** and **Admin Users** have access to the functionalities they need to effectively manage their respective tasks within the laundry booking system.

### Further developement point:
- Implement a User profile page for users to update their info. Will only need one new POST route in the backend to work.
- Fix state so that page reload is not necessary for certain changes in the state data to become visible to users.
- Let users see their own booking and cancel bookings..
